# **WIP** gw2api
`gw2api` is a **WIP** wrapper over the official Guild Wars 2 API written in **Rust** using
[reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) as the underlying request maker.

## Q&A
Q: Y u do dis?!

A: There simply weren't a fully functional API wrapper for the API which I needed.
It's also a good learning experience in how to write wrappers, planning out project structure
and implementing tests. All in all; yay.

## Shoutouts
* [tyria-rs](https://github.com/rmed/tyria-rs) - where I stole some of the project structure from.
I would have used this instead if it were complete.
